Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the frontier of computer science, encompassing the development of systems
capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.These include understanding natural language,
recognizing patterns, solving complex problems, and even learning from experience. AI systems are designed to analyze
vast amounts of data, uncover insights, and make autonomous decisions. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables
algorithms to improve their performance over time without explicit programming, by learning from data patterns.
As AI continues to advance, its applications span diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and
entertainment, promising transformative impacts on society while raising important ethical and societal questions about
its use and implications.
